# Number-Guessing-Game
Relational Database Practice

This is the freecodecamp relational database course project work to build a game of guessing a number.
The idea of the game to generate random number between 1 and 1000 and give a hit as telling the 
user wheather the secret number is higher or lower than user guessed number. After the user finds 
the number it shows the number of attempts the user had and secret number. There are two files 
such as number_guess.sh and number_guess.sql. The script number_guess.sh runs the game. The game 
saves the data about user game history in the number_guess database. This database can be rebuild 
with the number_guess.sql file as it is the dump of the number_guess database.

P.S. Thanks for freecodecamp for providing an oportunity to learn and study something new for free.
